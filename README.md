# 🕷️ Weaver 
## Your AI‑Powered Assistant

Weaver is an intelligent, agent‑driven development environment that can **modify your entire project from a single natural‑language prompt**. It understands your codebase, plans multi‑step edits, applies atomic diffs, verifies results, and even handles Git operations — all inside a beautiful, integrated IDE.

Control your agent remotely on Bughosted.com/Weaver

## Requirements

- .NET 10 SDK (or compatible runtime)
- OpenAI endpoint / llama.cpp server / Ollama 

## Run

From the `Weaver` folder:

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

The app serves static files and APIs. Open the URL shown in the console (usually `http://localhost:5000`).

---

### ⚙️ Advanced Settings
- OpenAI compatible backend
- Build commands  
- Token/context limits  
- File hints system  
- Email account integration  
- PR‑by‑default toggle  
- UI visibility toggles (IDE, Kanban, Calendar, Terminal)  

---

### 🌐 Live Web Testing
- Strictly-test prompts ("test that the kanban board loads", "is the agent panel working?") run a dedicated deterministic test pipeline with **zero LLM involvement**  
- Detects and launches the project's own server (dotnet, node, python, go, cargo, java, php, ruby, or static)  
- Verifies the named page/section in a real browser (headless Edge/Chrome via the Chrome DevTools Protocol, when available) or via direct HTTP probing  
- Reports check-by-check results on the card with a PASSED/FAILED verdict

---

## 🧬 Supported Languages

Weaver supports syntax highlighting and editing for:

**C#, Java, C/C++, JS, TS, JSX, TSX, HTML, XML, SVG, CSS, SCSS, LESS, JSON, SQL, Python, Ruby, PHP, Go, Rust, Swift, Markdown, YAML, Shell, Bash, PowerShell, Kotlin.**

## 🧨 Why Developers Love Weaver
- One prompt → entire project updated  
- Atomic, safe, reviewable diffs
- Review all terminal commands before they run, create a command approval list or approve all by default.
- Full IDE + Git + Kanban + Calendar in one app  
- Local, fast, private  
- Works with any project structure  
- Designed for real‑world development, not toy examples  
- Designed for any model type - big or small. The agent's iterative approach should yield similar results for smaller tasks. The bigger LLMs produce similar results in fewer cycles.



## FAQ

### Where to Start

1. Open the options popup (top right of screen)
2. Click on both 'projects' and 'settings' and configure the application
3. Start by adding a card in the kanban, adding files for context and then pressing start

`llamaUrl` specifies the address of your OpenAI API compatible LLM endpoint. This can be any compatible server such as Ollama, llama.cpp, or other local/remote LLM services. By default, Weaver looks for the server at `http://localhost:8080`. If your server runs on a different port or address, update this setting by opening the settings panel or in `weaverconfig.json` to ensure Weaver can connect to your LLM backend.

### What if the backend application won't close?

If the backend application won't close, try closing the website first. Sometimes the backend process remains active even after closing the browser tab, so explicitly closing the website interface can help terminate the backend application properly.

### Force File Edits
In cases where the edit pipeline isn't being chosen,
Employ 'Fix the' keywords to force the agent to make file edits. 
For example, phrase your request as 'Fix the README.md file to add a new section about forced edits' 
or 'Fix the configuration section to clarify the llamaUrl setting'. 
This mechanism ensures that the standard edit pipeline is automatically selected.

## Configuration

All settings are persisted in the database (`data/weaver.db`, `weaver_config` table) — there is no `weaverconfig.json` anymore. `llamaUrl` defaults to `http://localhost:8080`; edit it in the app's settings panel if your llama server is on a different address.

## Build & Publish

Publish a self-contained, single-file `Weaver.exe` (this is what gets uploaded to Bughosted.com/assets/Weaver.exe):

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64
```

Single-file, self-contained, native-library bundling, and appsettings embedding are all configured in `Weaver.csproj` (no extra flags needed — and note `/p:PublishSingleFile=true` breaks in Git Bash because MSYS rewrites `/p:` paths).

**One-command publish + verify** — `./publish.sh` (Git Bash) or `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File publish.ps1` (PowerShell) runs the publish, **fails if any native DLL was left beside the exe** (e_sqlite3 / tree-sitter must be bundled inside), **smoke-tests the lone exe from an empty temp folder** (server must stay up and log the welcome banner), and prints the **SHA-256 of `artifacts/Weaver.exe`** ready for upload.

**The published `Weaver.exe` is fully standalone**: it bundles the runtime, the SQLite native library (`e_sqlite3`), the tree-sitter parsers, the web UI, and `appsettings.json`. You can copy just `Weaver.exe` into a fresh folder (even an empty one) and it will run — the bundled files are extracted to `%TEMP%/.net/Weaver/` on first launch. The app creates its `data/weaver.db` next to the exe on first run, so the folder must be writable. Expect the exe to be ~200 MB — everything is inside it; don't enable `PublishTrimmed` to shrink it (TreeSitter/AngleSharp/MailKit are reflection-heavy and trimming would break them).

Testing command : dotnet test   (tests live in tests/UnitTests and compile into the main project)

Note: `dotnet test` runs everything including the live E2E suites — they launch the
project's real server (the built `Weaver.exe`, or `dotnet run` as fallback) and a real
headless browser via CDP when one is installed, so they exercise actual processes on
your machine. On machines without a browser (e.g. CI) those tests skip gracefully.
